## Installation

OS: Verified running on Windows 7 with Node and NPM.

### Installing and running the server
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/bnolan/scenevr.git
1. `cd scenevr`
1. `npm install`
1. `run bat`

Note: *you can replace hello.xml with any of the demo files*

### Installing and running the client
In a new console window, and in a new directory:

1. `cd scripts`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm install -g coffee-script`
1. `run bat`

You should now be able to open `localhost:9000` in your browser to see a list of scenes. You can edit these scenes in your favourite text editor, and when you hit save, the scene will automatically reload in your client.
